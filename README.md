## About Me

As a DevOps Engineer with a Master's degree in Computer Applications from Sri Krishnadevaraya University, my tenure at Accenture was marked by the successful deployment of scalable cloud infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines which significantly reduced deployment times. My work encompassed not only the technical execution but also the collaborative effort with cross-functional teams to enhance system stability and efficiency. 

My academic credentials laid a strong foundation in cloud technologies, enabling me to provision infrastructure with Terraform and manage Docker containerization effectively. I'm eager to continue harnessing my cloud computing and DevOps competencies to contribute to innovative solutions and embrace new challenges within the tech industry.
